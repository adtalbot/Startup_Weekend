## Synopsis

Startup Weekend Tracker is a simple Ruby application built by [Audrie Talbot](https://github.com/adtalbot) with the ability to track all teams and corresponding members of the Portland Startup Weekend. Crafted as part of the Spring 2015 Ruby course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).

## Motivation

Startup Weekend Tracker aims to help organize the teams participating in the Portland Startup Weekend.

## Code Example

The magic behind the Startup Weekend Tracker is a set of custom `Team` and `Member` classes with methods such as `Team#save`, `Team.clear`, `Team#define`, `Team.all`, `Member#save`,`Member.clear` and `Member.all` methods that act in sync to store, recall and correlate teams and their corresponding members.
